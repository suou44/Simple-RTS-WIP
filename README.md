# Simple-RTS-WIP
These are my C# files for my Unity-based RTS. It draws heavily from Edgar Storm's tutorial http://www.stormtek.geek.nz/rts_tutorial/index.php, but is optimized for 2D. So far I have implemented camera movement, a basic HUD, unit selection. I'm currently troubleshooting unit movement, as 2D movement is a little fiddly. I'm mostly using this as a learning experience for C#, since Edgar implemented most of the code, but I am troubleshooting it and modifying it to better fit my game. but I may release it as a smartphone app in the distant future.

The code doesn't really do anything without all of the Unity auxillaries and files structures, though.
